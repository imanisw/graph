       <div class="subheading"> Out of the 23 countries with women holding 40% or more of the seats in national parliaments and legislatures, these 6 stand out. Here's why.</div>

     <p class="intro"> NOVEMBER 11, 2021 - Women comprise nearly half of the world‚Äôs population and yet are underrepresented in most governments.</p>

     <p> This proves true for most countries and for many reasons. Historically, women have been at a socioeconomic disadvantage compared to their male counterparts and this of course affects their political and civic participation or at least makes it more difficult to break that barrier.</p>

     <p> Countries like Rwanda, Cuba, and New Zealand have some of the highest proportions of women in their governments. And while some have kept up consistent numbers, other countries maintain a steady increase over time. But what accounts for these numbers?</p>

     <iframe title="The U.S. Lags Behind Rwanda, Cuba when it comes to Women in Politics - Why? " aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-QSKZd" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QSKZd/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="399"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

     <p> It‚Äôs a question that‚Äôs been asked over and over, especially when the countries with the highest numbers of women in office are not as ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù economically or otherwise. [insert expert quote].</p>

     <p> That‚Äôs right. There are a lot of reasons why these numbers turn out the way they do. First, gender quotas. These initiatives reserve seats that only women can hold or make it so that government entities must have a certain number of women in office. Second, mass civil upheaval and civil conflict. I know, hard to believe, but stick with me. </p>

     <p> Civil war and genocide cause major disruptions in social relations, creating vacumn that allows for new interpretations of women‚Äôs roles. In the case of Rwanda, specifically, peace talks, new electoral commissions, and truth and reconciliation processes following the 1991 genocide allowed for state-building that become more inclusive of women at the time. </p>

     <p>But there is the question of ‚Äúwhat happens next?‚Äù Having large numbers of female representation does not inherently mean the quality of life for women in these countries increases. There is still debate amongst academics about whether having this political presence even benefits or reflects the demands of women in those countries.</p>
